Note: I chose to follow all StyleCop rules this time
so there is not list of excluded features

Note: There is a stylecop violation regarding use of "" instead of
String.Empty, but these dont provide the same functionality in this case
so i ignored this.

HW10 IMPORTANT:
There will be no testing/commits for steps 1 and 2 of the homework
because I already implemented these functionalities back when I
was doing general testing and implementation for the cell reference
formulas. All i have left to do is the circular reference handling.
